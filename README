Compiling:
gcc44 -O3 -ffast-math -march=core2 fragfold.c -lm -o fragfold
(ignore warning about using tmpnam)


FRAGFOLD libraries:
Define FDATA_DIR and FTDB_DIR environment variables and point them to data/ folder.
Otherwise, FRAGFOLD assumes library files are in the same location as FRAGFOLD.


Folding:
fragfold T0281.nfpar output.pdb

Running FRAGFOLD once will generate one single model. For structure prediction you
need to generate an ensemble of say 100 models or more and perform some form of
final model selection (e.g. structural clustering or energy-based selection).
The more models you are able to generate, the more accurate the final model is likely to be.
Typically you would use a cluster of machines to generate these models, but if
you are prepared to wait, you can obviously just run FRAGFOLD on a single computer.

Refinement:
fragfold T0281_refine.nfpar output.pdb T0281_initial.pdb
